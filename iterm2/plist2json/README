Use:

python ~/some/dir/batch-plist-to-json.py

Drag and drop folders onto the terminal or type in directory names. Creates a new directory for the output if the one you specify doesn't existâ€¦ outputs to the same directory as input if you leave the output field blank.

Why?
Because you made a bunch of plist files for your OS X or iOS apps, and now you want to use JSON for better portability and ease of use.

If it helps you out, buy me a beer some time.

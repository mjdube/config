This is a true black/grey/white theme for vim. I would say it is as close as I have seen to what the original vi editors looked like (think elvis).

To install:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors/
    wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanpcmcquen/true-monochrome_vim/master/colors/true-monochrome.vim -P ~/.vim/colors/

Add this to your vimrc:

    colorscheme true-monochrome
